LifeCvars
=========

Stores the global config files for the Life GMod addon.


In the interest of keeping this part of the addon as "open" as possible, this repository is where we will keep the main configuration file that defines all of the console commands that we run in Life.

There are three reasons for this:
1. it means that the list of commands is not locked away inside the GMA and you can read it whenever you want, just to make sure we aren't doing anything bad.
2. it means that we can't change the list without a commit message being stored, and you can look through every revision of the file to know that we didn't do something bad.
3. it means that we don't have to update the workshop addon each time we want to tweak this list.
