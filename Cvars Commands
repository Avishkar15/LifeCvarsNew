THIS WILL KEEP GETTING UPDATES FROM TIME TO TIME, THIS IS NOT THE FULL RELEASE YET!

Do you have any more cvars that might make your GMod better? Post them on the mod page!

== Textures ==

mat_parallaxmap 0-1  == Enables Parallax Mapping which can improve visual quality. // May severely impact perfomance!
mat_compressedtextures 0-1  == Disables compressed textures to improve texture appearence. // May severely impact perfomance!
mat_wateroverlaysize 0-9999  == Increases quality of water.
mat_envmapsize 0-9999  == Raises the allowable physical dimensions of a texture.
mat_envmaptgasize 0-9999  == Raises the allow physical dimensions of a sprayed texture.

== Prefixes ==

mat_specular 0-1  == a HotFix for shiny objects on the map.(Turns off/on specular lightning.)

== Shadows / Lightning ==

cl_drawownshadow 0-1  == Draws own shadow in first person mode.
r_projectedtexture_filter 0-2  == Smooths the shadows.
r_shadowmaxrendered 0-9999  == Increases quality of shadows

r_maxdlights 0-9999  == Maximum number of dynamic lights visible on the screen.

---- These don't work for some reason ;c
r_cheapwaterstart  == Start of the CheapWater rendering (all before this range is expensive waterrendering).
r_cheapwaterend  == Range beyond which water effects are reduced.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

== Distance ==

r_lod 0-5  == Rate at which level of detail is stripped from objects as they recede away from the player. // May impact perfomance!
lod_TransitionDist 0-9999  == Range at which detail props are shown.
cl_detailfade 0-9999  == Range at which detail props fade into view.
r_propsmaxdist 0-9999  == Maximum visible distance.
cl_detaildist 0-9999  == The range at which detail props are shown.(e.g. grass).

== Models / Decals ==

mp_usehwmmodels 0-1  == High quality faces [TF2 Models Only]
mp_usehwmvcds 0-1  == Uses high quality facial animations [TF2 Models Only]
cl_ragdoll_collide 0-1  == Prevents characters from merging into each other due to ragdoll effects. // May impact perfomance!
r_maxmodeldecal 0-9999  == Maximum number of decals which can be drawn on a model.
mp_decals 0-9999  == Maximum amount of decals visible at one time.
r_decals 0-9999  == Maximum amount of decals possible at any one time.

== Other ==

jpeg_quality 0-100  == Specifies the default quality percentage for screenshots.
cl_burninggibs 0-1  == Will cause the gibs from players who are killed while on fire to display fire effects.
mat_motion_blur_forward_enabled 0-1  == Adds movement motion blur.
mat_motion_blur_strength 0-10  == Increases the strength of the movement motion blur.
mat_postprocess_y 0-10  == Improves post-processing effects by X.
mat_postprocess_x 0-10  == Improves post-processing effects by Y.

== Perfomance == 

ai_expression_optimization 0-1  == Disables NPC expressions when you can't see them, potentially improving performance.
sv_robust_explosions 0-1  == Explosions will be less spectacular, but this may improve performance.
snd_noextraupdate 0-1  == Disables unnecessary updating of sound files which improves perfomance.
cl_forcepreload 0-1  == Forces all information to preload, reducing loading pauses and stuttering by not loading information on the fly.
sv_forcepreload 0-1  == Forces server-side preloading, reducing loading pauses and stuttering by not loading information on the fly.
r_fastzreject 0-1  == Activates a fast z-setting algorithm which takes advantage of hardware fast z reject for improved performance. (if it is on -1 it auto detects of how it should be).

== Cheats (needs to have sv_cheats to be set on 1) ==

r_rootlod 0-1  == Gives ultra level of detail of distance. // May impact perfomance!
mat_picmip -10  ==  gives Ultra quality on textures. // May impact perfomance!
mat_fullbright 0-1  == All objects will up brightly lit up.
cl_maxrenderable_dist 0-9999  == Maximum distance from the camera at which things will be rendered.
r_eyeglintlodpixels 0-9999  == Allows eyes to be rendered at full quality across the map.
r_avglight 0-9999  == Puts more lighting on objects.

== Multi-Thread == 

snd_mix_async 0-1  == This command will allow multi-core CPUs to run most of the sound engine in parallel with the renderer, which can improve performance and reduce stuttering.

more coming s00n!
